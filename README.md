# ErgattaSaveThePrincess
Stub project built for Ergatta written by Matt Edzenga

This project establishes a broad layout and organization of the project without specific gameplay implementations.  This includes systems for managing the player, enemies, npc's, stats, and more without establishing the behavior of those objects.
